# Delivery tracker
The Loft Digital coding monkeys have finished all their bananas, so they ordered 400 kg fair
trade bananas, which were transported from Brazil to London. You are given a stack of
delivery notes for various transportations that took the bananas from Brazil to London via
several stops on the way. All of the delivery notes are out of order. Each delivery note
contains information about the means of transportation, from destination to destination and
about the delivery service provider.
